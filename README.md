#The name of this app is DyscAid which is developed for people with Dyscalculia.
This is the initail phase of app later lots of alteration was made in this app. I am going to upload the modified on which was developed both Bengali and English pretty soon. But first of all lets be clear you gonna find 2 files empty as later those features during development of app was discarded.

In this app mainly four functions are focused.
1. Calculation
2. Count
3. Monetary
4. Transpose

Here both Count and Calculation has the same features.

**Calculation**
In this activity the is voice input funtion. After pressing the mic image the user need to speak the answer he is looking for. For example if he need to know the value of consine 150 degree.
Then he should say cosine 150 degree and the result will be shown at the below textbox and by pressing the speaker icon the user can listen to the answer which is shown in textbox. 

**Count**
This activity does  the same job as Calculation Activity but here user have to type the mathematical term. For example add 23 with 123 then the result will appear in the result textbox and by clicking the button the user can hear the result.
Even though they use the same feature the idea behind is that if the user is unable to talk then he can type for the results.

**Monetary**
In here there are two functions. Total money and check the return. Both of the them are done by the users. Here there is graphical representaion of Bangladeshi Taka by clicking which the user can check to money. There is also voice output. So by pressing the speake button the listen to his total money.

**Transpose**
In here text recognition is used. Here the ocr extracts the text from the image then regex code is used to extract the number from the image. The user has both options open, one is taking picture and then extract, other one is seeking a picture from galley. Cause both camera and gallery permission is given in manifesto file.

**Disclaimer**
1. This is the old version of the instruction set of how using this app was not added.
2. In this app the system can't take one digit number. For example 25 divided 5 is not allowed. Both numbers have to be more then one digit.
